## Three Step Approach :-
1) Scraped the data using web scraping from different mooc websites.
2) Make a database of the scraped data.
3) Make a REST API to get that data.


## Step 1:
For the example purposes I have only scraped data from coursera website for 3 search results, C++, Java, and Python. After scraping them and storing them in a temp location I have stored them in a mongo database.
## Step 2:
I then made an REST API to send request to that database and generate responses using endpoints.

## To generate the results, follow these steps :

1) Clone this repo.
2) ``` $ cd scrapy/quotetutorial```
